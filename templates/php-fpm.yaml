        PHP-FPM Zabbix Template with Auto Discovery and Multiple Pools.
        - Provides auto discovery of PHP-FPM pools (LLD)
        - Detects pools that via socket and via TCP
        - Supported types of PHP process manager; dynamic, static, on-demand.
        - Supports multiple PHP versions, i.e. you can use PHP 7.2 and PHP 7.3 on the same server and we will detect them all.
        Original Authors Homepage https://github.com/rvalitov/zabbix-php-fpm
        Upgraded to Zabbix v6.0 Schema, and validated against Zabbix 7.0.4

                The current number of connections that have been initiated, but not yet accepted. If this value is non-zero it typically means that all the available server processes are currently busy, and there are no processes available to serve the next request. Raising pm.max_children (provided the server can handle it) should help keep this number low. This property follows from the fact that PHP-FPM listens via a socket (TCP or file based), and thus inherits some of the characteristics of sockets.

                The upper limit on the number of connections that will be queued. Once this limit is reached, subsequent connections will either be refused, or ignored. This value is set by the php-fpm per pool configuration option 'listen.backlog', which defaults to -1 (unlimited). However, this value is also limited by the system (sysctl) value 'net.core.somaxconn', which defaults to 128 on many Linux systems.

It typically means that all the available server processes are currently busy, and there are no processes available to serve the next request. Raising pm.max_children (provided the server can handle it) should help keep this number low. This trigger follows from the fact that PHP-FPM listens via a socket (TCP or file based), and thus inherits some of the characteristics of sockets. Low values of the listen queue generally result in performance issues of this pool. The queue length is defined by the backlog option in your pool's configuration.
